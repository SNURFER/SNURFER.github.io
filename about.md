Born in the South Korea. Loves to ride a board. Snow board, skate board, surf board... at last, arrived to key board!

  Started serious programming during the master's course in order to simulate neutrons in the nuclear reactor core. Leap to software development in TmaxOS, for the development of product "ToOffice" based on C++ Linux. Interested in c++ developing, CI/CD, Linux environment, and vim.
  
  This blog is simply created for my curiosity clearance. I plan to organize the coding related contents in this blog. Nice to meet you
